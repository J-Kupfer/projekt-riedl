**1. Overview**


**Goal:**

• Build a pipeline to read PDF documents, store their contents in a local vector store, and answer user queries by retrieving relevant context and then generating a response using a local large language model (LLM via Ollama).


**Key Points:**

1. **Language:** Python.

2. **Libraries/Frameworks:**

• [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) for RAG components (document loaders, text splitting, retrieval, chain management).

• [LangGraph](https://github.com/amosjyng/langgraph) for pipeline orchestration and graph-based chaining logic.

• A **local vector store** (e.g., [Chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) or [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)) for storing embeddings and performing similarity searches.

• [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) for running local language models.

3. **Use Case:**

• Ingest PDF documents.

• Parse, clean, and chunk data.

• Generate embeddings.

• Store embeddings locally.

• Retrieve relevant chunks for a given user query.

• Use a local LLM to generate a final answer with the retrieved context.

**3. Detailed Specifications**


**3.1 Document Ingestion & Processing**

1. **Document Loader (LangChain)**

• Use PyPDFLoader or a built-in PDF loader from LangChain to read PDF files.

• Extract both textual content and metadata (title, author, etc., if needed).

2. **Text Splitting**

• Utilize LangChain’s RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (or CharacterTextSplitter) to chunk the PDF text into manageable segments.

• This step ensures the local LLM has smaller, context-specific segments to work with during retrieval.

3. **Metadata Handling**

• For each chunk, store relevant metadata:

• Document name or ID

• Page number (if possible)

• Source path

• This metadata can be useful for traceability and additional context.

**3.2 Local Vector Store**

1. **Choice of Vector Store**

• Use a local solution like **Chroma** or **FAISS**.

2. **Embedding Generation**

• Use a locally hosted embedding model or an open-source embedding model from HuggingFace.

• Ensure the embeddings are generated offline (or locally) before storing them in the vector store.

3. **Ingestion Flow**

• For each PDF:

1. Load text.

2. Split into chunks.

3. Generate embedding for each chunk.

4. Insert chunk + embedding into the vector store.

• After ingestion, you have a local vector store that can quickly retrieve semantically relevant chunks.

4. **Persistence**

• Configure the vector store to be **persistent**:

• Example with Chroma: define a persistent directory where the index data is stored (e.g., db/chroma).

• This ensures that the vector store is reused across sessions without needing to re-embed all documents.

**3.3 Retrieval**

1. **Query-time Retrieval**

• When a user sends a query, run the query through the same embedding model to get a query embedding.

• Perform a similarity search (e.g., vectorstore.similarity_search(query_embedding, k=3)) to retrieve the top k relevant chunks.

**3.4 Orchestration with LangGraph**

1. **LangGraph Setup**

• Use LangGraph to define a workflow (graph) that orchestrates:

1. PDF ingestion to vector store.

2. Query → retrieval → local LLM generation chain.

3. **Graph Nodes**

• **Node A: PDF Ingestion** – loads, splits, and stores embeddings in vector store.

• **Node B: Query Input** – user input node.

• **Node C: Retrieval** – uses the vector store retriever node to fetch relevant documents.

• **Node D: Answer Generation** – local LLM inference node with the retrieved context.

3. **Execution Flow**

• The pipeline runs Node A either once initially (for ingestion) or periodically to update the store when new PDFs are added.

• At query time, Nodes B → C → D are executed in sequence:

• B: The user enters a query.

• C: Retrieve chunks from the vector store using the query embedding.

• D: Send the user’s query + top chunks to the local LLM (Ollama).

**3.5 Local LLM Integration (Ollama)**

1. **Ollama Installation & Setup**

• Ensure Ollama is installed and running on your local machine.

• Download or specify the local model you want to use (e.g., llama2, GPT4All, etc.).

2. **LangChain Ollama Integration**

• In Python, you can create a custom LangChain LLM class or use any existing integrations that can call Ollama’s local API or CLI.

3. **Answer Generation with Context**

• Combine the user’s query and the retrieved chunks into a single prompt:
• Send this prompt to Ollama using your custom LLM class or via the integrated method if available.

4. **Performance & Caching**

• Since Ollama runs locally, consider caching or ephemeral “chat sessions” if needed.

• Adjust model hyperparameters (max tokens, temperature, etc.) as your hardware permits.

**3.6 RAG Chain (LangChain) Configuration**

 **RetrievalQAChain (LangChain)**

• Use RetrievalQA from LangChain to tie everything together.

**Flow:**

3. A query is passed into qa_chain.run(query).

4. The chain uses retriever to find top k chunks.

5. The chain “stuffs” these chunks into a prompt with the user’s query for the local LLM.

6. The local LLM (Ollama) returns the final response.

7. **LangGraph Integration**

• Encapsulate the above chain in a node, or connect a graph node to the chain so that a user query triggers the entire retrieval + generation path.

**4. Deployment & Environment**

1. **Local Environment Requirements**

• Python 3.9+ recommended.

• GPU (optional but recommended) if your local LLM benefits from GPU acceleration.

• Sufficient RAM for the chosen model.

 **Dependency Management**

• Keep a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml with pinned versions of.

• Ollama installed separately (outside Python environment).

• Ensure any environment variables needed by Ollama or Python are properly set.


**5. Operational Considerations**

1. **Updating the Vector Store**

• New PDFs may be added regularly.

• Provide a script or a function in the pipeline (using LangGraph or a scheduled job) to re-ingest or update the vector store with new documents.

2. **Handling Large PDFs**

• Chunking is crucial. Adjust chunk_size and chunk_overlap for best performance.

• Potentially skip pages without textual content or remove unneeded boilerplate text.

3. **Prompt Engineering**

• Fine-tune the system and user prompts for best results. This might include specifying format, style, or disclaimers.

4. **Error Handling**

• Handle PDF parsing errors (some PDFs are scanned images, missing metadata, etc.).

• If a retrieval returns no relevant chunks, consider default fallback responses or re-check your chunking/embedding strategy.

5. **Security & Privacy**

• All data remains local, which is a plus for privacy and compliance.

• Ensure no personal/sensitive data is inadvertently exposed. Use metadata-based filtering if needed.

**7. Future Extensions**

• **UI/Frontend**: Integrate a lightweight web-based UI or a Streamlit app to allow interactive querying and answer display.

• **Advanced Retrieval**: Explore additional retrieval methods (e.g., hybrid keyword + vector search).

• **LLM Fine-tuning**: If desired, fine-tune a local LLM with domain-specific data or advanced prompts.

• **Document-Level Summaries**: Store short summaries for each PDF in a metadata field; retrieve those summaries for quick responses.

• **LangChain Agents**: Incorporate agent-based approaches if you want the pipeline to handle more complex tasks like reading multiple documents or performing actions beyond QA.
